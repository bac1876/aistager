## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AiStager
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Node.js dependencies (for Vercel deployment):
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and add your API keys:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your keys:
```
# Required for AI staging
REIMAGINEHOME_API_KEY=your-reimaginehome-api-key

# Recommended for reliable image hosting
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# Alternative image hosting
IMGBB_API_KEY=your-imgbb-key
```

Get your API keys at:
- ReimagineHome: https://www.reimaginehome.ai (7-day free trial)
- Cloudinary: https://cloudinary.com (free tier available)
- ImgBB: https://api.imgbb.com (free tier available)

### 4. Run Development Server

Flask backend:
```bash
python app.py
```

Visit http://localhost:5000 to see the app.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Render (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit [render.com](https://render.com) and create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - Runtime: Python 3
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn app:app`
5. Add environment variables in Render dashboard:
   - `REIMAGINEHOME_API_KEY`
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
6. Deploy!

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop or click to upload a room photo
2. **Select Room Type**: Choose from Living Room, Bedroom, Kitchen, etc.
3. **Choose Style**: Select a design theme or let AI decide
4. **Generate**: AI stages your room with appropriate furniture and decor
5. **View Results**: Get your professionally staged room image

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Embedded HTML with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) with gunicorn
- **AI Service**: ReimagineHome API for virtual staging
- **Image Hosting**: Cloudinary (primary), 0x0.st (fallback)
- **Deployment**: Render.com

## Development

### Current Implementation (app.py)
- Uses ReimagineHome API for professional virtual staging
- Implements webhook-based asynchronous processing
- Automatic image hosting with Cloudinary (falls back to 0x0.st)
- Stores recent stagings for user convenience

### Alternative Implementations
- `app_dalle.py`: Uses OpenAI DALL-E for image generation
- `app_controlnet.py`: Uses Replicate's ControlNet
- `app_reimaginehome_*.py`: Various ReimagineHome integration approaches
- `main.py`: Simple local-only implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Image Upload Issues
- Ensure Cloudinary is configured in `.env.local`
- Check that your image is under 10MB
- Verify the ReimagineHome API accepts the image URL

### Staging Not Completing
- Check webhook URL is accessible (not localhost when deployed)
- Verify ReimagineHome API key is valid
- Check browser console for errors

### API Key Issues
- ReimagineHome offers a 7-day free trial
- Ensure API key is properly set in environment variables
- Test API connection with `python test_api_status.py`

## Current Status (July 29, 2025)

### Recent Changes
- **Fixed Environment Variables**: Resolved issue where environment variables weren't loading in Vercel due to ES modules configuration
  - Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json
  - Converted all API files from ES modules to CommonJS
  - Downgraded node-fetch from v3 to v2.7.0 for CommonJS compatibility

- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated InstantDecoAI for virtual staging
  - Fixed authentication issues with Bearer token format
  - Ensured all required parameters (room_type, design, block_element) are included in requests
  - Current API key: bhqAdea6X9lehYWyi5HzZ9Z5gobNhm00

- **Webhook & Polling System**: Implemented dual approach for receiving results
  - Created `/api/webhook-receiver` endpoint to receive results from InstantDeco
  - Created `/api/check-result` endpoint for polling results
  - Frontend polls check-result endpoint which checks both webhook storage and memory
  - Removed test endpoints to stay under Vercel's 12 function limit

### Architecture Notes
- **Current Endpoints**:
  - `/api/stage.js` - Main staging endpoint that uploads images to ImgBB and calls InstantDeco
  - `/api/webhook-receiver.js` - Receives and stores results from InstantDeco webhooks
  - `/api/check-result.js` - Polling endpoint that checks for completed results
  - `/api/health.js` - Health check endpoint
  - `/api/recent-stagings.js` - Returns recent staging history

- **Image Flow**:
  1. User uploads image ‚Üí Base64 encoded
  2. Backend uploads to ImgBB ‚Üí Gets URL
  3. Sends URL to InstantDeco with webhook URL
  4. InstantDeco processes and sends results to webhook
  5. Frontend polls check-result until completion

### Known Issues & Solutions
- **Timeouts**: InstantDeco can take 30-60 seconds, implemented polling with 180s timeout
- **Vercel Function Limit**: Limited to 12 functions on hobby plan, removed test endpoints
- **CORS**: All endpoints properly configured with CORS headers

### Next Steps
- Deploy current webhook implementation
- Monitor webhook reliability in production
- Consider database for persistent storage instead of in-memory
